Writing your own functions
In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that
accept multiple arguments and return multiple values.
You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.

#A brief introduction to tuples
#Unpack nums to the variables num1, num2, and num3.
#Construct a new tuple, even_nums composed of the same elements in nums,
# but with the 1st element replaced with the value, 2.
nums = (3,4,6)
# Unpack nums into num1, num2, and num3

print(even_nums)

#Functions that return multiple values

#Modify the function header such that the function name is now shout_all, and it accepts two parameters, word1 and word2,
# in that order.
# Concatenate the string '!!!' to each of word1 and word2 and assign to shout1 and shout2, respectively.
# Construct a tuple shout_words, composed of shout1 and shout2.
# Call shout_all() with the strings 'congratulations' and 'you' and assign the result to yell1 and yell2
# (remember, shout_all() returns 2 variables!).

# Define shout_all with parameters word1 and word2
def shout_all(word1, word2):
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    # Construct a tuple with shout1 and shout2: shout_words
    shout_words = (shout1,shout2)
    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words


# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout_all(): yell1, yell2
yell1, yell2 = shout_all('congratulations','you')
# Print yell1 and yell2
print(yell1)
print(yell2)
#Hint
##Check that you have the correct number of parameters in the function header.
##You concatenate strings with the use of the + operator.
##Remember that tuples are constructed with parentheses ().
##Make sure you unpack the result of shout_all() into the correct number of variables. To unpack a 2-tuple tup into two variable a, b, execute a, b = tup
